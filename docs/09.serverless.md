# Serverless

### ASGI

While Hikari's standard RESTBot implementation works by running an AIOHTTP server, this isn't the only way you can listen to interactions as a REST server.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/serverless.py:22:29"
```

The utility library [Yuyo][yuyo] provides an [ASGI implementation of RESTBot][yuyo.asgi.AsgiBot] which allows for running an interaction server with any ASGI v3 compatible REST server. The above examples shows this being used as
a sub-app in a FastAPI server but `ASGIBot` can otherwise be used as the "app" when running using an ASGI web server
implementation like Uvicorn or Gunicorn.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/serverless.py:33:37"
```

Thanks to the flexibility of the ASGI standard, this can also be used with serverless frameworks people have
implemented ASGI adapters for. The above example uses [agraffe](https://pypi.org/project/agraffe/) to create
an entry point for AWS Lambdas, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions.
