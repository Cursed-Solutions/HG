# Events

Events are the bread and butter of how bots know what's happening on Discord.
They are received over the gateway bot's connection and let us detect anything from someone
joining or leaving a guild to moderation action to people creating messages.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/events.py:19:27"
```

In this basic example we listen for message create events from actual users and send the response
message `"Good morning human-kyun"` if the content matches `"Hello Botto".

### Intents

Remember "intents" which were mentioned briefly earlier, well these are important here as we have to
make sure that the correct intents are enabled for the events we want the bot to listen for when
creating [hikari.GatewayBot][hikari.impl.gateway_bot.GatewayBot]. More information on which intents
are needed for an event can be found at [hikari.Intents][hikari.intents.Intents] and if an event
isn't mentioned in this list then it is always enabled.

##### Privileged intents

An important point to note is that the message create event that examples listens for is considered
"privileged" by Discord meaning that you have to enable them in Discord's application settings before
the bot can declare them.

![intents location part 1](./images/find_intents_1.png){ width=40% }

First go to the "Bot" section of the application you want to enable these settings for.

![intents location part 2](./images/find_intents_2.png){ width=80% }

Then scroll down until you reach "Privileged Gateway Intents" and enable the intents you need.
The presence intent lets the bot monitor the statuses of guild members, the server member intent
lets the bot track who is in a server, and the message content intent lets the bot see every message
users send (without this the bot will only see the content of messages which mention it).

### Client lifetimes

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/events.py:39:49"
```

Hikari provides 4 event types which can be used for managing state around the client's lifetime:

* [hikari.StartingEvent][hikari.events.lifetime_events.StartingEvent]: called when the bot's starting
* [hikari.StartedEvent][hikari.events.lifetime_events.StartedEvent]: called when the bot's finished starting
* [hikari.StoppingEvent][hikari.events.lifetime_events.StoppingEvent]: called when the bot's started closing
* [hikari.StoppedEvent][hikari.events.lifetime_events.StoppedEvent]: called when the bot's finished closing

It should be noted that Tanjun provides its own lifetime management system on-top which isn't tied
to the bot type you're using. More information on this can be found in Tanjun's guide
[here](https://tanjun.cursed.solutions/usage/#client-lifetime-management).

### Wait for an event

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/events.py:53:76"
```

[GatewayBot.wait_for][hikari.impl.bot.GatewayBot.wait_for] can be used to wait for the next
received event which matches a type and predicate (filter). In the above example we wait
60 seconds for a message update event where `event.message_id` matches a specific message
and process the next edit or delete the message if we don't get a response in time.

### Event streams

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/events.py:78:87"
```

[GatewayBot.stream][hikari.impl.bot.GatewayBot.stream] provides an asynchronous iterator which
you can use to iterate over events as they're received. This comes with several chainable methods
such as the filter method (more information on which can be found on
[LazyIterator][hikari.iterators.LazyIterator]) and will cache events received between iterations.
The `limit` keyword argument can be used to limit how many events are cached and, while `timeout`
defaults to [None][] (unlimited) for this, you likely want use `timeout` to specify how many
seconds it should wait between events before ending iteration.

### Event handling in frameworks

Just a final note, frameworks which build on top of Hikari will have their own abstractions and
approaches of handling listening to events.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/events.py:91:101"
```

Tanjun (while minimally invasive) tracks event listeners primarily through its "Components"
using the decorator method [Component.with_listener][tanjun.abc.Component.with_listener],
and the method [Component.add_listener][tanjun.abc.Component.add_listener] which add dependency
injection support to event dispatch and register the relevant event listeners when the Tanjun
client is started; `with_listener` adds support for unions when parsing event types from the
callback's signature but otherwise matches [GatewayBot.listen][hikari.impl.bot.GatewayBot.listen].
