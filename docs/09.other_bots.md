# Other Bot Impls

There are several non-standard implementations of Hikari's bot interfaces which
come with their own features and benefits.

### ASGI

While Hikari's standard RESTBot implementation works by running an AIOHTTP server,
this isn't the only way you can listen to interactions as a REST server.

The utility library [Yuyo][yuyo] provides an [ASGI implementation of RESTBot][yuyo.asgi.AsgiBot]
which allows for running an interaction server with any ASGI v3 compatible REST server.
This can be used as the "app" when running using an ASGI web server implementation like Uvicorn
or Gunicor, or even as a FastAPI sub-application.

More information on this can be found in [https://yuyo.cursed.solutions/usage/asgi/](Yuyo's guide).
