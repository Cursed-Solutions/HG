# Commands

While you can make commands without Hikari, this guide is only going to cover
using a command client to make them as they make it a lot easier.

These examples will be using [Tanjun](https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tanjun).
Tanjun is a command framework which wraps around Hikari to provide ways declare
and handle both modern application (slash) commands, traditional message
(prefix) commands, and context menus.

### Making commands

##### Slash commands


##### Prefix commands


##### Context menus


### Loading commands

Tanjun doesn't let you load commands directly into its clients, instead you
need to create a [tanjun.Component][tanjun.components.Component] instance and
load the commands into it then load that into the client.

There's 2 different ways to load commands into a component:



### Loading into clients
