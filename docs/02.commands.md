# Commands

While you can make commands without Hikari, this guide is only going to cover
using a command client to make them as they make it a lot easier.

These examples will be using [Tanjun](https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tanjun).
Tanjun is a command framework which wraps around Hikari to provide ways declare
and handle both modern application (slash) commands, traditional message
(prefix) commands, and context menus.

### Making commands

##### Slash commands

Slash commands are the commands you'll see in Discord when you start by "/" in
the message box.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:17:49"
```

![find_intents_1](./images/slash_command_example_1.png){ width=49% }
![find_intents_1](./images/slash_command_example_2.png){ width=49% }


There's a few things going on in this example.

First off, [tanchan.doc_parse.as_slash_command][] is used to create a command
by wrapping a command callback while using the callback's name (ban_user) as
the command's name and using the first line of its docstring as the slash
command's description.

Then [tanchan.doc_parse.with_annotated_args][] parses the function's parameter
type-hints to work out the slash command's options while parsing per-option
descriptions from the docstring's "Parameters" section.

It should be noted that [Tanchan](https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tan-chan)
is a separate optional utility library which builds ontop of the system tanjun
provides in [tanjun.annotations][] to add support for docstring parsing.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:53:57"
```

##### Prefix commands



##### Context menus

### Checks

### More annotated types

### Loading commands

Tanjun doesn't let you load commands directly into its clients, instead you
need to create a [tanjun.Component][tanjun.components.Component] instance and
load the commands into it then load that into the client.

There's 2 different ways to load commands into a component:



### Loading into clients

other ways to declare commands) see its [usage guide](https://tanjun.cursed.solutions/usage/).
