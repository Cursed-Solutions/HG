# Commands

Slash commands are the commands you'll see in Discord when you start by "/" in
the message box.

This guide is only going to cover using a command client to make commands as,
while you can make commands with just Hikari, command clients makes it a lot
easier and are the recommended approach.

These examples will be using [Tanjun](https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tanjun).
Tanjun is a command framework which wraps around Hikari to provide ways declare
and handle both modern application (slash) commands, traditional message
(prefix) commands, and context menus.

### Making Slash commands

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:20:53"
```

![first slash command example](./images/slash_command_example_1.png){ width=49% }
![second slash command example](./images/slash_command_example_2.png){ width=49% }

There's a few things going on in this example:

First off, [tanchan.doc_parse.as_slash_command][] is used to create a slash command
by wrapping a command callback. This is using the callback's name ("ban_user") as
the command's name and using the first line of its docstring as the slash
command's description.

Then [tanchan.doc_parse.with_annotated_args][] parses the function's parameter
type-hints to work out the slash command's options while parsing per-option
descriptions from the docstring's "Parameters" section.

This example uses `default_member_permissions` to mark the command as
limited to only members who have permission to ban users unless this
configuration is overridden by guild staff. It also uses `dm_only` to
marks the command as only working in guilds.

It should be noted that [Tanchan](https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tan-chan)
is a separate optional utility library which builds on top of the system tanjun
provides in [tanjun.annotations][] to add support for docstring parsing.

##### Ephemeral responses

The "only you can see this" responses you're seeing here are called
ephemeral responses, these are unique to slash and context menu commands.
While this example uses `default_to_ephemeral=True` to mark all the command's
responses as ephemeral, you can also pass `ephemeral=True` while calling
[AppCommandContext.create_initial_response][tanjun.abc.AppCommandContext.create_initial_response]
or [AppCommandContext.create_followup][tanjun.abc.AppCommandContext.create_followup]
to mark individual responses as ephemeral.

##### Slash command groups

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:57:64"
```

![slash command group example](./images/slash_command_group_example.png)

Since normal slash commands can't have spaces in their names, you have to use
slash command "groups" to get spaces. These are limited to only being nested
once (so a slash command group can be put in a top-level group but you can't
put a group in that sub-group) and some configuration is limited to top level
commands so for what you can configure for sub-commands see
[SlashCommandGroup.as_sub_command][tanjun.commands.slash.SlashCommandGroup.as_sub_command] and
[SlashCommandGroup.make_sub_group][tanjun.commands.slash.SlashCommandGroup.make_sub_group].

### Making message commands

Message commands are the classic command approach which listens for user
messages which start with a certain prefix or bot mention and then processes
the rest of the message's content for command execution.

The `{GUILD}|{DM}_MESSAGES` [intent][intents] has to be enabled for these
commands to work and without the privileged
[hikari.Intents.MESSAGE_CONTENT][hikari.intents.Intents.MESSAGE_CONTENT] intent
command execution will only work for mention prefixes.

Since these match based on the prefix, you must also set some prefix for the
client to match against using either [tanjun.clients.Client.add_prefix][] or
by passing `mention_prefix=True` when initialising the bot (calling
[Client.from_gateway_bot][tanjun.clients.Client.from_gateway_bot]).

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:68:73"
```

The above example shows a message command that would be triggered by
`{prefix}meow` and where the "weebish" argument can optionally be provided
by sending `{prefix}weebish true`.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:77:87"
```

The above example takes advantage of message command groups to group
sub-commands together. The group itself will be callable as
`{prefix}uwu group` and the sub-command will be callable as
`{prefix}uwu group echo {content...}`. `Greedy` marks this argument as
taking the rest of the positional arguments and doesn't effect slash
commands.

### Making context menus

Context menu commands are the simplest of the 3. These are the buttons you see
when you right click on a user or message under "Apps". These have similar
configuration to slash commands but cannot be nested, have more relaxed name
restrictions and do not have descriptions nor options.

##### Message context menus

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:100:115"
```

![message menu example](./images/message_menu_example.png)

There's message context menus which will always take
[hikari.Message][hikari.messages.Message] positionally as their 2nd argument.

##### User context menus

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:91:96"
```

![user menu example](./images/user_menu_example.png)

And there's user context menus which will always take
[hikari.InteractionMember][hikari.interactions.base_interactions.InteractionMember]
positionally as their 2nd argument.

These examples use `delete_after` to tell Tanjun to delete the response after 30
seconds if it still exists.

### Multi-commands

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:119:132"
```

When you want to use a command callback for multiple commands types there are a few
things you'll have to note. The bases classes of [tanjun.abc.Context][] or
[tanjun.abc.AppCommandContext][] (if this is only being used for slash and menu
commands) should be used to type the first argument as these are base classes
which only have cross-compatible features present (e.g. ephemeral responses
are not implemented for the base `Context` as this isn't supported by message
commands).

Command decorators like [tanchan.doc_parse.with_annotated_args][] and the
`with_{}_check` decorators present in [tanjun.checks][] come with an optional
`follow_wrapped` argument. Setting this to [True][] will make it apply the
decorator's change to every compatible command declaration in that decorator
chain (rather than just the one it's directly on).

When using the same callback for a context menu and slash or message command
you'll have to make sure the main option can be passed both positionally
(as the 2nd argument) and by its name since context menus will still pass it
positonally.

### Checks

Checks are callbacks which decide whether a command or group of commands should
run for a command execution context. There's a collection of checks in
[tanjun.checks][] which can be applied to any command type.

These can be added to commands through decorator calls (e.g. `@tanjun.with_guild_check`)
or by calling `command.add_check(check)`.

<!-- ### More annotated types

The message and slash command examples use Tanjun's [tanjun.annotations][] system to
declare commands. -->

### Loading commands

Tanjun doesn't let you load commands directly into its clients, instead you
need to create a [tanjun.Component][tanjun.components.Component] instance and
load the commands into it then load that into the client.

There's 2 different ways to load commands into a component:


```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:144:156"
```

If you build the component first then you can use the
[Component.add_command][tanjun.components.Component.add_command] and
[Component.with_command][tanjun.components.Component.with_command] methods
to add commands to the component directly. `with_command` supports
`follow_wrapped`.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:136:140"
```

Alternatively, you can call `load_from_scope` at the end of the module to
load command objects (plus some other objects like schedules) into the
component from the module's top level automatically.

### Loading into clients

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:160:164"
```

Component loaders give an easy way to load functionality and commands into a
tanjun client from a module.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:169:175"
```

Normally you'd load modules straight into the client as shown in the example above.
[Client.load_modules][tanjun.abc.Client.load_modules] loads from specific modules
while [Client.load_directory][tanjun.abc.Client.load_directory] loads from the
modules directly in a directory (no recursion). While `load_modules` takes python
module paths (same paths you use in `import` syntax), `load_directory` takes a
system path and the python module path for that directory as the keyword argument
`namespace`. The namespace is appended onto python file names as
`f"{namespace}.{path.name[:3]}"`.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/commands.py:179:189"
```

Tanjun also provides a standard hot reloader implementation which has a similar
interface to [Client][tanjun.abc.Client] for marking modules to track and will
reload or unload target modules when it detects a that its file has been changed.
[tanjun.HotReloader][] will also redeclare application commands when they're
changed unless `redeclare_cmds_after=None` is passed to its init.

Only one of these approaches should be used at the time since they'll conflict
with each other.
