# Message Components

This guide is only going to cover using [Yuyo][yuyo]'s component client to make
commands as, while you can make commands without Hikari, higher level clients
make it a lot easier and is the recommended approach.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/components.py:18:23"
```



```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/components.py:26:52"
```


```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/components.py:55:63"
```

### And now for something completely different

This guide only covers one of [Yuyo][yuyo]'s different approaches for declaring
and handling components, only giving a basic overview. For more information on
Yuyo's components functionality see its
[usage guide](https://yuyo.cursed.solutions/usage/components).
