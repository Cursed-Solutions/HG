# Message Components

Message components are the interactive buttons and select menus you'll see on
messages sent by bots.

This guide is only going to cover using [Yuyo][yuyo]'s components client to make
and handle components as, while you can use components with just Hikari, higher
level clients make it a lot easier and is the recommended approach.

### Making components

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/components.py:18:23"
```

The above examples shows using [yuyo.components.ActionColumnExecutor][] to
declare and handle message buttons.

![button colours](./images/button_colours.png)

There are several different "styles" of buttons, as shown above. Most button
styles are interactive (meaning that the bot will be told when they're pressed)
except link buttons, which opens the relevant link in a browser for the user
who clicked it.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/components.py:26:52"
```

![select menu example](./images/select_menu_example.png)

Message components also include select menus. These allow users to select 1 or
more options (dependent on the configured `min_values` and `max_values`),
telling the bot which options they've picked. Most select menu types will
pre-populate options for users (whether that be users, channels, or roles), but
text select menus require the bot to pre-define up to 25 string options for it.

By default `min_values` is set to `0` and `max_values` is set to `1`, but
`max_values` can be set to up to `25` to allow the user to select multiple
options before finalising (sending) the interaction.

### Rows

While [ActionColumnExecutor][yuyo.components.ActionColumnExecutor] abstracts away building individual,
action rows you still need to be aware of the restrictions around them:

* A message can have up to 5 rows.
* A row can only contain one select menu.
* A row can contain up to 5 buttons (regardless of the style).

[ActionColumnExecutor][yuyo.components.ActionColumnExecutor] will always append
components to the last row if possible or add a new row. this means that if your
second row only has 1 button but there's a 3rd which is a select menu then an
add button call would add a 4th row for the button.

### Sending components

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/components.py:55:63"
```

### And now for something completely different

This guide only covers one of [Yuyo][yuyo]'s different approaches for declaring
and handling components, only giving a basic overview. For more information on
Yuyo's components functionality see its
[usage guide](https://yuyo.cursed.solutions/usage/components).
