# Modals

Modals allow bots to prompt users for more information as the initial response
for a slash command, context menu or message component interaction.

This guide is only going to cover using [Yuyo][yuyo]'s Modal client to make and
handle modals as, while you can use modals with just Hikari, higher level
clients make it a lot easier and is the recommended approach.

### Making modals

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:18:30"
```

Modals take the shape of dialogue boxes which show up on top of everything else
for the user who triggered the relevant interaction. The above example shows up
in the client like this:

The only supported field type for modals is "text inputs" right now. Text inputs
(as the name suggests) let the user input text to send to the bot and a modal
can have up to 5 text inputs in it, each taking up to 4000 characters.
The bot will not be told if a modal pop up was cancelled or closed without
submission.

### Rows

Modals also have the concept of "rows" in a similar sense to message components
and [Modal][yuyo.modals.Modal] also handles creating new rows for you.
Right now text inputs always take up a whole row.

### Sending a modal

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:33:40"
```

As shown above, creating a modal in response to a slash command, context menu,
or message component use is simple. First you register this modal instance to a
top-level custom ID by calling
[ModalClient.set_modal][yuyo.modals.ModalClient.set_modal] (which defaults to 1
use and a 2 minute timeout). Then you can pass
[Modal.rows][yuyo.modals.Modal.rows] to `create_modal_response` as `components`
alongside the top-level custom ID and the model's title. A modal can only be
triggered as the first response (before deferring).

### Row! Row! Fight the power!

This guide only covers one of [Yuyo][yuyo]'s approaches for declaring modals
and only gives a basic overview. For more information on Yuyo's modals
functionality see its [usage guide](https://yuyo.cursed.solutions/usage/modals).
