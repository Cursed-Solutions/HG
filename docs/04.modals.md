# Modals

This guide is only going to cover using [Yuyo][yuyo]'s Modal client to make
commands as, while you can make and handle modals without Hikari, higher level
clients make it a lot easier and is the recommended approach.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:18:30"
```

Modals allow bots to prompt users for more information as the initial response
for a slash command, context menu or message component interaction.

These take the shape of dialogue boxes with the above example showing up in
the client like this:

![modal_example](./images/modal_example.png)

The only supported field type for modals is "text inputs" right now. A modal
can have up to 5 text inputs in it, each taking up to 4000 characters.
The bot will not be told if a modal pop up was cancelled or closed without
submission.

```py
--8<-- "./docs_src/modals.py:34:41"
```

As shown above, creating a modal in respones to a slash command, context menu,
or message component use is simple. First you register this modal instance to a
top-level custom ID by calling
[ModalClient.set_modal][yuyo.modals.ModalClient.set_modal] (which defaults to 1
use and a 10 second timeout). Then you can pass
[Modal.rows][yuyo.modals.Modal.rows] to `create_modal_response` as `components`
alongside the top-level custom ID and the model's title.
The used Modal custom ID must be unique and passing a constant value for
`timeout` (e.g. [None][] or a custom instance of [yuyo.timeouts.BasicTimeout])
allows you to reuse a registered modal or to relax or enhance the timeout time.

### Row! Row! Fight the power!

This guide only covers one of [Yuyo][yuyo]'s approaches for declaring modals
and only gives a basic overview. For more information on Yuyo's modals
functionality see its [usage guide](https://yuyo.cursed.solutions/usage/modals).
