Before using this guide to learn Hikari it's recommended that you make sure you understand basic concepts and how they work in Python such as object-oriented , and asynchronous programming. This knowledge is really important for properly grasping libraries like Hikari. If that all seems like a bit much for you and you don't really have a firm grasp on Python yet then I recommend trying a basics course (like Real Python ) before using Hikari as libraries like this can be challenging to use without that foundational knowledge.
